## Who are we?
<p style="text-align:justify;">
This blog aims to share information and knowledge about the latest trends and innovations in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Data Science</b>.
<br><br>
You will find articles and presentations addressed to all types of readers, from the neophyte to the specialist, provided by experts working on our various projects, ranging from data analysis to <i>machine learning</i> and <i>deep learning</i>, including computer vision and natural language processing.
<br><br>
VANIILA's blog will allow professionals in the field and all those interested in innovative technologies to access a reliable source of information written by doctors and engineers from the Algorithms and Data Department of the <a href="https://catie.fr">CATIE</a>. The challenges and solutions presented in the articles are directly inspired by our projects or are answers to questions we frequently receive from companies. We also share code in <a href="https://github.com/catie-aq">open source</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/CATIE-AQ">trained models</a>. 
<br><br>
We hope to contribute to the promotion of AI knowledge and experience to stimulate innovation, foster AI collaborations and actively participate in the ecosystem of which CATIE is an integral part as a Technology Resource Center.
<br><br>

The CATIE is a <a href="https://esr-islabel.adc.education.fr/label-crt">Research and Technology Organization (RTO)</a> whose primary mission is to support and accompany SMEs, ETIs and other structures in their development and digital transformation projects. The CATIE is proud to collaborate with research laboratories, universities and industrial partners to promote <b>artificial intelligence</b>.<br>
We also actively participate in the scientific dissemination of skills that may be judged inaccessible by some structures. Thus, we widely disseminate our expertise and the results of our work through our technological innovation platforms, such as <a href="https://www.vaniila.ai/">VANIILA</a>, dedicated to AI. We offer an environment for development and calculation for rent. The structures have access to jupyter notebooks and SSH access to servers equipped with GPUs to train their models.
