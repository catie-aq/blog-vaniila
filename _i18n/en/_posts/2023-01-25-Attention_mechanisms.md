# Introduction

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Attention mechanisms are a groundbreaking development in the field of machine learning, revolutionizing the way sequences are processed.<br>
In this informative video, we will delve into the inner workings of these mechanisms, exploring two  architectures - recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers.
By providing a comprehensive overview of these architectures, we will demonstrate their applications to two domains of machine learning: natural language processing and computer vision.
