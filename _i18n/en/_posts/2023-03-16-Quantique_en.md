# Introduction
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Quantum computing is a rapidly expanding field that holds enormous potential for revolutionizing industries such as cryptography, logistics, and systems modeling. By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, quantum computers can perform calculations that would be impossible with classical computers.<br>
In this video, you will gain a basic understanding of qubits and how they enable quantum computers to process information at lightning-fast speeds.
